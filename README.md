## Overview

- Select "Mark all as read" to toggle the visual state of the unread notifications and set the number of unread messages to zero
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In particular I wanted to use the precompiler SCSS in a project. I also wanted to implement best Accessability pracitices such as allowing elements to be interactable using tabindex.

### Continued development

I want to add more interactivity to future pages, as well as best accesibility practices.

### Useful resources

- [The A11y project](https://www.a11yproject.com/) - This helped me identify accesability features for this page.
- [Wes Bos JS](https://wesbos.com/beginner-javascript) - Great online course for strong JS fundamentals.
